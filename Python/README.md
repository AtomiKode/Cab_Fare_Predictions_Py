# Cab_Fare_Predictions_Py
Prediction of fare amount for cab rides in NYC using machine learning algorithms.

The projects contains 3 files and was done in 3 parts:
- The first part deals with cleaning of the train data and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
- The second part deals with cleaning of the testing data and 
- Third part deals with prediction of fares in the test data.

This repository also contains the original train and test dataset used as well as clean dataset for both train and test. Also, the project report is included.

Following is the summary of the contents of the project: -
- Implemented project in Python with RMSE of 3.697.
- Performed Data Cleansing, Missing Value Analysis and Imputation as well as Outlier Analysis.
- Prepared correlation plot (heatmap) and histograms and bar graphs.
- Implemented machine learning models like: Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM and XGboost.
- Used error metrics like RMSE, MAE and AIC to determine performance of the models.
